    "Here is the example we'll be using for this topic: satellite data. A seminar speaker in Oceanography in fall 2015, Dr. Chuanmin Hu, shared information about some of his algorithms for satellite data processing. Satellite data gives an incredible spatial scale of information but require quite a bit of clever processing to get out the data that researchers actually want to use. This becomes increasingly true as we collectively build more complex algorithms to root out new perspectives, and to try to remove visual obstacles like clouds. Dr. Hu, in particular, has found a way to remove sun glint from some satellite data, which can be very useful if you care about a latitude where this tends to be a problem.\n",

    "> The other option for getting started is to go straight to the site’s search functionality.
